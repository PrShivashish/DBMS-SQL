4 types of joint:
1)Inner join-A intersection B(common from A and B)
2)left join- Left Table + Inner join
3)Right join-Right Table + Inner join
4)Full join-Left Table + Right Table + Inner join

Sub-Query-Query inside another query(Subquery is a query whose result are used by another query)
Q.Find average salary filter employees where salaru is greater than avg salary'
select employees,salary from table where salary>(select avg(salary) from table 

Transaction: A Transaction is a sequence of sql operations executed as a single unit where either all changes are commited or all rolled back(ALL ARE NOTHING)

Start transaction
	SQL Statement 1
	SQL Statement 2
	SQL Statement 3
	SQL Statement 4
COMMIT (Save changes)
OR ROLLBACK

Indexting:it helps sql find data faster,just like a book index or page number
without index:
	start from page 1
	read every page
	very slow
with index:
	go to index
	directly jump there

Drawbacks of indexing:
	Don't use when the table is small
	It occupies some space
	Insert,Update,Delete becomes slow after indexing
